Linear programing is done via the Revised Simplex Method (also known as the Primal Simplex Method), the Dual Simplex Method or an Interior Point Method. Some solvers like cplex allow you to specify which method you use, but we won’t go into further detail here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer Programing\n",
    "Integer programs are almost identical to linear programs with one very important exception. Some of the decision variables in integer programs may need to have only integer values. The variables are known as integer variables. Since most integer programs contain a mix of continuous variables and integer variables they are often known as mixed integer programs. While the change from linear programing is a minor one, the effect on the solution process is enormous. Integer programs can be very difficult problems to solve and there is a lot of current research finding “good” ways to solve integer programs. Integer programs can be solved using the branch-and-bound process.\n",
